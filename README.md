# Farisu-Web-Based-Travel-Guide-System

This is a simple Java app for my Travel Guide System. It allows users to manage their travel destination which allows users to choose their location destination, accomodation, Flight class, Family type, Airport departure, Hotel type and price, and also their names and ages. Subtotal and total prices will be added up and all the information shall be shown in the receipt. This system features a database system which uses MySQL to store User's account and User's information.
