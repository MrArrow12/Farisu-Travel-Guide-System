# Farisu-Web-Based-Travel-Guide-System

This is a simple Java app project for my Travel Guide System. It allows users to manage their travel destination that contains:
-User's location destination
-Accomodation
-Flight class
-Family type
-Airport departure
-Hotel type and price 
-and also their names and ages. 
-Subtotal and total prices will be added up and all the information shall be shown in the receipt. 

This system features a database system which uses MySQL to store User's account and User's information. Users need to create their account before accessing travel management.
